Overview
---

In this project we use the concepts from computer vision to manipulate color spaces, apply blurs, 
find edges,  apply masks using openCV and other Python libraries.

The project includes the Python notebook with the pipeline that process images and draws
lines on the image. It also includes the Write up where I hope to explain my thinking 
when solving this problem. And the folder named _test\_videos\_output is used to store processed
videos. You can find these files named as follows:

* final\_writeup.md
* P1.ipynb
* test\_videos\_output
